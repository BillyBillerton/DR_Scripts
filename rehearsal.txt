Ladies and gentlemen, what we present tonight is more than just a work of fiction. Though our players are playing their roles, two of them will be leaving here tonight with, perhaps, more than they bargained for. Let us join them now in "The Case of the Heart-Thief".Thief! Thief!"

Your honor, I tell you, this 'ere woman is a thief!; What she did to me is, well, it's simply beyond belief.; Though I ask that you bear witness while I tell me tale; I can only hope, that in this case, justice will prevail; There I was, minding me business, all alone in the night; When suddenly, there she was...and what a pretty sight; I couldn't move, couldn't breath, couldn't tear me eyes away; From one so sweet an' charming no one ever expects foul play

We talked long into the night an' then I no longer could resist; So I leaned right over and gave her, just the lightest little kiss; And just when I started to realize that I didn't have a clue; That is when she leaned over and, your honor, she kissed me too; That was when it happened, all sudden-like, and quick; Me stomach flipped, then it flopped, I started feeling sick!; I knew right then and there that she 'ad stole me heart

I don't know exactly 'ow but I suspect it was black art!; I ask that you jail her and lock her away forevermore; Don't let her roam the streets to steal again, of you I do implore; To the door of her cell, you could give me the key; For she still has me heart and she won't set it free.

But I was mistaken your honor, she didn't steal me heart!; And I'd be completely lost without her, were she ever to depart; This wonderful little thief, she means everything to me; And I love her your honor, so won't you please set her free?; Better yet, yes, I can see it so clearly now that I beg for her life; Instead of killing her, won't you sentence her to be my wife?

From the moment we met you have held my heart in your hands; And if you'll marry me there will be no happier person in all of the lands; I love you Jilette, won't you please be my wife?; And do me the honor of staying with me for life?

Well it seems our lovers have both managed to escape unscathed and we leave this story with a very happy ending…
