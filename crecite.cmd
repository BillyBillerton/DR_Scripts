put recite May Saemaus' blessing be upon your love, that it will bring happiness, joy and laughter to you forever.\;Albreda send us peace and prosperity, and grant long life to our nation.  May her gentle blessings bring healing to our lands.\;Murrula, protect me as I travel and grant me inspiration in my music.  May my singing fall pleasantly upon your ears and win approbation from my audience.\;May Rutilor's wisdom and justice guide my dealings with others, keeping me honorable and true to myself.\;Lady Eylhaar, may your frigid caress meet my skin before the vicious sting of Aldauth's beak.
