put 'We Rakash're a proud people, despite all we 'ave sacrificed an' all we 'ave lost, we survive. Many a' us come from great lineages of warriors an' hunters, leaders an' great men who have their deeds told in song an' story.

pause 12

put say /softl This however is not one of their stories. This is the story of my family." He allows his feigned accent to drop as he continues on the more serious topic. "Or more accurately my lineage."

pause 10

put say We weren't warriors, we weren't leaders and we weren't hunters. We were the the unsung heroes of Odcoru and the packs outside its walls

pause 10

put say /proudl You see, my family were the scouts, the first to move ahead, the first to figure out where to hunt and often the first to fall.

pause 10

put say /sadl Despite all they gave, their names are not in the tales of the heroes. 

pause 10

put 'Today, I hope to correct that. As the last of my family line, I have a story to honor these scouts. If any of your families were amongst our ranks, I hope I honor them as well.

pause 5

put recite The night was dark and the small pack gathered around a glowing fire, waiting for their Alpha to come out and speak.\; Amongst the crowd just at the edge of the fire light stood a group of smaller Rakash.\; Their coats black as night, accented in a soft white, their frames more wiry and agile than the bulk of the warriors or hunters.\; They stood with their eyes forward, but their ears listening to everything around them.\; This small gathering knew that whatever was coming, they needed to be ready at a moment's notice.

pause 15

put smil lost in a reverent memory of a time he never knew.

pause 10

put recite As the Alpha approached the pack, there was grave worry on his face, many of the gathered grew uneasy. They had never seen their leader so unsure of something before.\; The large Rakash calmed his nerves and addressed his people, his tone steady as he spoke, "The time to move is here once again."\;He paused briefly to let the words land before continuing.\;"There is still food and water here, but something else is coming.\;A messenger arrives from the west, sent from Odcoru with a warning, there is evil in this land.

pause 20

put say /fearful The small gathering at the edges perked their ears and turned away, they knew their time was here. Each checked the blade of their grusana kaft, the weight of their svidaw sis, readying them just in case. Each already clad in their lightweight midnight-blue Odaj. They knew their orders would be delivered and they were ready to receive them.

pause 20

put recite The Alpha continued, "There are rumors of dead warriors rising again after falling on the battlefield, only they are twisted and corrupted. They fight now for the enemy.\; There are warnings of magics being used, so foul that they taint the land itself.\; We have been asked to begin moving east. All packs are to meet and make the migration together." \; His voice lowered as he gave the command his scouts knew was coming, "My trusted scouts, your time has come again. I ask of you more than I have ever asked before.\; I need a contingency to go west towards Odcoru, meet their scouts on the path and make sure it is safe.\; Another I need to check to the east, ensure there is a clear way out and know where the water and the food on the path can be found.

pause 25

put say /softl Each scout simply nodded, there was a reason they were known as klusesana -silence-. They moved with stealth and speed, they had their own language, one of gestures and movement." He pauses a moment, accenting his words with a gesture outward, two fingers circling in front of himself. "Their lives dedicated to the safety of the pack, they were among the beloved of Coshivi, their purpose singular.

pause 25

put recite One of the gathered scouts counted out three, he pointed west, their journey more direct than one to the east requiring less of the group.\; Each of the three nodded and with a silent prayer to their watchful patron the selected began moving west.\; The others gathered and without a word began their journey east.\; The pack knew better than to alert any of the departure and held until they were sure the scouts were away.\; Once enough time had passed each Rakash gathered sunk down and gave their howl, the tone calling the scouts home, wishing them safety on their journey.

pause 20

put say /darkly Though they were loved by Coshivi and blessed by their pack, they would not all return as they had left.

pause 12

put recite The scouts to the east moved in the night, spread out as individuals, but close enough to quickly close in on any danger they might face.\; They stopped frequently to smell the air or feel the grass, looking for any signs of life in their vicinity. As they moved on, they faced little issue until they began hearing loud footsteps.\; The head of the scouting party gestured and each of them melted into the shadows, ears alert, eyes focused and hands on their blades.

pause 15

put recite They sat, quietly waiting for the first sign of trouble when the source of the commotion came into view.\; A pack of Prydaen moved through their path, too many to be a scouting party, wagons loaded and moving at a steady pace through the night.\; The Rakash waited in their shadow knowing the path was no longer viable, too much noise, the wheels leaving clear tracks where they had mapped.\; And so with a heavy sigh the leader motioned for the group to backtrack and scout a new path.

pause 20

put say /sadl Their brethren to the west did not fare as well, the details of their story unfortunately lost with them. What we do know is the next morning they returned to camp. The three of them moved, not as silence, but with rigid, almost jerky movements. They had been corrupted, fallen somehow on their path and risen again. The warriors of the tribes took up arms and with heavy hearts dispatched those who just the night before had been brothers and sisters to the pack.

pause 20

put smile a grim half-smile as he lifts his head, looking over the gathered, a single tear rolling down his cheek. He breathes deep, collecting himself again.

pause 10

put 'The guards and warriors kept their eyes to the west, ready for the others to come back twisted. After a week had passed the party returned home, more importantly they returned as themselves. 

pause 20

put 'The cartographer among them presented a map to their Alpha, her hand tracing the trail that would safely lead them to water, each potential campsite marked, the place the Prydaen had wandered crossed off, marked as a no-go zone.

pause 20

put sigh

pause 5

put say /sadl As their explanations finished, the pack Alpha approached them, his gaze sad as he informed them of the loss. 

pause 15

put say /reverentl The scouts, though singular to purpose were not unfeeling and each of them wept openly at the news, tears streaming freely between them. Their numbers had always been small, the loss of even one brother or sister was felt by all of them. The scouts' leader turned to the Alpha, -all gathered around got to share in a rare moment- and spoke. "Tonight we honor them, tonight we tell their tales. Any who wishes to hear of Tawvsana, Kluvens and Tawvtaka are welcome to join. Any who cannot, please pray for them."

pause 2

put weep

pause 15

put say Their Alpha could not deny their request, he knew all they had given. He would not however be able to attend. It was not his place to disrupt their ceremony or to draw attention away from the fallen. But, as he laid down to rest, each of their names crossed his lips in a prayer to Coshivi as they had each night since they had come back to their.

pause 20

put slip kaft

pause 5

put 'Any that have seen me as I am meant to be knows I am blessed with their coat. The black and white of a scout. It is why I tell their tales and I keep the grusana kaft of my ancestors near me at all times. It may not be a practical weapon here, but it carries their spirit.

pause 15

put tap kaft

pause 5

put 'And that is my tale of the scouts, so forgotten that we do not even remember what the word for scout was in our native tongue. Remember their deeds and let them live again in story.
