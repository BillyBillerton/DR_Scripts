put sing Good Divyaush, guide my work and don't withhold your vast indulgence from my family.\;Praise be to Berengaria, bringer of the dawn light, queen of the morning!\;May Firulf's foresight guide my path, and may my magic be the bane of accursed abominations.\;May Phelim send me sweet dreams and true visions.\;May Kuniyo guide my steps in the wilderness and my blade in the midst of battle.\;May Alamhif grant us his protection and guidance on our journey back from death's void.\; Softly sing out praises to Peri'el, whose gentle voice lulls the World Dragon in its eternal slumber.\;Lemicus, guide those who sail on the sea, and bring them back safely to those who wait upon the shore.
